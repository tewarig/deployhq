# Core.md

This doc contains initial though process of building the core of deployHQ.

The project will run something like this...
I am thinking of two version deployHQ lite and deployHQ 

Lite version will just have single instance and will be able to run freely. 
it will ship with minimum things and the original version will run with everything.
